# Makefile for compiling Noda Time under mono.
# See tools/developer-src/markdown/building.txt for requirements.

# Assumes that 'mono', 'xbuild' and 'nunit-console' point to appropriate
# versions of the respective tools. If this is not true, override the
# two assignments, either by editing the below, or by running 'make XBUILD=...'

MONO := mono
XBUILD := xbuild
NUNIT := nunit-console
# For example, to use a version of NUnit that has been unzipped somewhere else,
# use something like the following instead.
# NUNIT := mono ../NUnit-2.6.1/bin/nunit-console.exe

# Targets:
#   debug (default)
#     builds everything (including tests, benchmarks, demo code, the zoneinfo
#     compiler, etc) in debug configuration
#   release
#     builds everything in release configuration, including the XML
#     documentation (which is not built by default)
#   check
#     runs the tests under NUnit.
#   clean
#     runs the Clean target for all projects, removing the immediate output
#     from each.  Note that this does not remove _all_ generated files.
#
#   docs
#     builds the Markdown-based documentation generator, and updates the
#     user and developer guides (in docs/{userguide,developer}).

# Override the profile: Mono only supports the 'full' .NET framework profile,
# not the Client profile selected in the project files for the desktop build
# configurations.
#
# Note that while xbuild from Mono 3.0 'supports' Portable Library projects, it
# actually builds them against the desktop .NET framework, so the fact that
# we're overriding the profile here for those configurations is unimportant
# (and the main reason there are no PCL targets defined here).
