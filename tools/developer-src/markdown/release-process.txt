Release Process

This document describes how Noda Time is released. It is intended to be used as
a checklist by the person doing a release.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2012
- Sandcastle and Sandcastle Help File Builder
- NuGet command-line tool
- Access to the Noda Time release private key (to produce a strong-named
  assembly) and the nuget.org API key

Note that we should not build releases on Mono at present, since the resulting
IL triggers a bug in the .NET 4 64-bit CLR (see the
[building and testing](building.html) section in the developer guide).

## When to release

When everybody's happy, there are no issues outstanding for the milestone, and
all the tests pass.

Search the issue tracker for open issues with the right label (e.g.
`label:Milestone-1.0`).

Update to the candidate revision (probably tip) of the correct branch (e.g.
`1.0.x`) and [build and run all the tests](building.html) as normal. The build
and test steps should pass on Visual Studio 2012 and at least one supported
OS/version combination for Mono (i.e. 'Mono 2.10.9 on Linux').

## Update the embedded tzdb

If necessary, update the version of tzdb on the branch to the latest current
version, following the instructions in the
["Updating the time zone database"][tzdb] section in the user guide.

[tzdb]: ../userguide/tzdb.html

## Pre-release branching

Before building the first release with a given minor version number (i.e. 1.0.0,
1.1.0, or more typically, a -beta or -rc version of the same), we'll need to
branch. New user-visible functionality is introduced with a new minor version
number (per the [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org) spec).

The branching model used by Noda Time is the Subversion-style backport model.
In brief:

- feature development is carried out on the default branch
- named branches (called '1.0.x', '1.1.x', etc) are used for release lines
- fixes are typically backported to the earlier branches where necessary
  (typically using `hg graft`).

Note the difference between the format of names used for tags ('1.0.0-beta2',
'1.0.0') and those used for branches ('1.0.x'). Mercurial will allow both to be
used as revision specifiers, so it is important that they do not collide.

## Making the release

Switch to the correct branch (e.g. `1.0.x`).

Update the following AssemblyInfo files and NuGet package specs to include the
version number you are building:

- `src/NodaTime/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `src/NodaTime.Testing/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `src/NodaTime/NodaTime.nuspec`
- `src/NodaTime.Testing/NodaTime.Testing.nuspec`

The various versions should be set according to the following scheme. Suppose
we were building version 1.2.3-beta4, then:

- In the NuGet package specs, `<version>` should contain the version number
  ('1.2.3-beta4'). The `<dependency>` element in `NodaTime.Testing.nuspec`
  should reference the _initial release_ for the major/minor version
  (i.e. '1.2.0').
- In the AssemblyInfo files, `AssemblyVersion` should be set to just the
  major/minor version ('1.2'). `AssemblyFileVersion` should be set to the
  major, minor, and patch version ('1.2.3'), and `AssemblyInformationalVersion`
  should be set to the version number ('1.2.3-beta4'). (See [this Stack
  Overflow post][assemblyversion] for more information about how these are
  used.)

[assemblyversion]: http://stackoverflow.com/a/65062

(Typically, only the version number itself should need to change, as the other
fields should already have been set correctly.)

Add the current date and TZDB version to the version history in
`tools/userguide-src/markdown/versions.txt` and regenerate all documentation.

Commit the above, then tag that commit:

    hg tag 1.0.0-beta1

Push these changes to Google Code.

## Building the release artifacts

First, *create a new clone for building the release*. Doing this avoids the
need to worry about ignored files and local changes making their way into the
source archive.

Update to the correct revision, if you didn't specify it when cloning the
repository:

    hg up -r 1.0.0-beta1

Export the clean source archive:

    hg archive NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1-src.zip

Next, get ready to build the release zipfile. Create a directory in the root of
the working copy called e.g. `NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1` containing a copy of the
following files and directories (from the working copy):

    docs/api/
    docs/developer/
    docs/userguide/
    LICENSE.txt
    NOTICE.txt
    NodaTime Release Public Key.snk
    readme.txt

Now copy the Noda Time release private key (`NodaTime Release.snk`) into the
root of the working copy and build the release libaries, XML documentation, and
NuGet packages:

    buildnuget.bat

This will create e.g. `nuget/NodaTime.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg` and
`nuget/NodaTime.Testing.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg`.

Copy the following build outputs into the _root_ of your zipfile directory:

    docs/PublicApi/NodaTime.xml
    docs/PublicApi/NodaTime.Testing.xml
    src/NodaTime/bin/Signed Release/NodaTime.dll
    src/NodaTime.Testing/bin/Signed Release/NodaTime.Testing.dll

(These are the same files as are present in the NuGet packages.)

Finally, create a zipfile. In the working copy root, run e.g.

    zip -r -9 NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1.zip NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1

TODO: doing this by hand is a pain.

## Publishing the artifacts

Upload the source and release zipfiles to the
[Google Code project](http://code.google.com/p/noda-time/downloads/list).
Use the `Type-Source` label for the source zipfile, and the `Type-Archive` and
`Featured` labels for the release zipfile.  Remove `Featured` from the previous
binary zipfile.

Upload the two NuGet packages to nuget.org:

    nuget push NodaTime.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg
    nuget push NodaTime.Testing.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg

## Announcing the release

Post to the mailing list, blog, etc.

## Post-release branch updates

If this release required the creation of a new branch, then the following files
on the *default* branch should be updated to bump (at least) the minor version
number (and `NodaTime.Testing` dependency version), per the scheme above:

- `src/NodaTime/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `src/NodaTime.Testing/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `src/NodaTime/NodaTime.nuspec`
- `src/NodaTime.Testing/NodaTime.Testing.nuspec`

The version number string should be of the form `1.1.0-dev`.
