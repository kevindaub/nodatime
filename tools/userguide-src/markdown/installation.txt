Installation

Our primary distribution channel is [NuGet](http://nuget.org) with
two packages:

- [NodaTime](http://nuget.org/packages/NodaTime)
- [NodaTime.Testing](http://nuget.org/packages/NodaTime.Testing)

System requirements
-------------------

Currently Noda Time requires .NET 3.5 (client profile). It supports
Mono ([with some caveats](mono.html)) but does *not* support
Silverlight (or, by extension, Windows Phone 7). We'd like to
support these in the future, but it will involve a non-trivial
amount of work.
