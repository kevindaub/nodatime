The following standard patterns are supported:

- `f`: Full format, displaying all information including fractional seconds.
  Typical pattern text: `+H:mm:ss.fff`
- `l`: Long format, displaying information down to the second.
  Typical pattern text: `+H:mm:ss`
- `m`: Medium format, displaying information down to the minute. Typical pattern
  text: `+H:mm`
- `s`: Short format, displaying information down to the hour. Typical pattern
  text: `+H`
- `g`: general pattern. Formatting depends on the value passed in:
  - If the offset has fractional seconds, the full format is used; otherwise
  - If the offset has seconds, the long format is used; otherwise
  - If the offset has minutes, the medium format is used; otherwise
  - The short format is used

  When parsing, the other standard format patterns are tried one at a time.
