(None of this is implemented yet!)

Noda Time can only represent values within a limited range. This is for pragmatic reasons:
while it would be possible to try to model every instant since some estimate of the big
bang until some expected "end of time," this would come at a significant cost to the
experience of the 99.99% of programmers who just need to deal with dates and times in a
reasonably modern (but not far-flung future) era.

The Noda Time 1.x releases supported years between around -27000 and +32000 (in the Gregorian
calendar), but had significant issues around the extremes. Noda Time 2.0 has a smaller range,
with more clearly-defined behaviour.

Ranges for calendars
-----

The "main" calendar for Noda Time is the Gregorian calendar. (We actually use `CalendarSystem.Iso`
by default, but that's just the Gregorian calendar with slightly different numbering around centuries;
it doesn't affect ranges.) This is the maximal calendar: a date in any other calendar can *always* be
converted to the Gregorian calendar.

Additionally, all calendars are restricted to four digit formats, even in year-of-era representations,
which avoids ever having to parse 5-digit years. This leads to a Gregorian calendar from 9999BC to
9999AD inclusive, or -9998 to 9999 in "absolute" years. The range of other calendars is determined from this
and from natural restrictions (such as not being proleptic).

The date range is always a complete number of years - the range shown below is inclusive at both ends, so every
date from the start of the minimum year to the end of the maximum year is valid. (The min/max Gregorian year
shows the Gregorian year corresponding to the min/max calendar values; this does *not* mean that the whole of
that Gregorian year can be converted into the relevant calendar.)
