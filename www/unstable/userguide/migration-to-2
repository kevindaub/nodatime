Noda Time 2.0 contains a number of breaking changes. If you have a project which uses Noda Time
1.x and are considering upgrading to 2.0, please read the following migration guide carefully.
In particular, there are some changes which are changes to execution-time behaviour, and won't show up as compile-time errors.
