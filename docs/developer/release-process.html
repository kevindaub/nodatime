    <h1>Release Process</h1>
    <p>This document describes how Noda Time is released. It is intended to be used as
a checklist by the person doing a release.</p>

<h2>When to release</h2>

<p>When everybody's happy, there are no issues outstanding for the milestone, and
all the tests pass.</p>

<p>Search the issue tracker for open issues with the right label (e.g.
<code>label:Milestone-1.0</code>).</p>

<p>Update to the candidate revision (probably tip) and
<a href="building.html">build and run all the tests</a> as normal. The build and test
steps need to pass on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2008</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010</li>
<li>Mono 2.10.5</li>
<li>Mono 2.10.8</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2010</li>
<li>Sandcastle</li>
<li>TODO: anything else? Release keys? Logins to nuget.org?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that we cannot build releases on Mono at present, since they trigger a bug
in the .NET 4 64-bit CLR (see the <a href="building.html">building and testing</a> section
in the developer guide).</p>

<h2>Update the embedded tzdb</h2>

<p>If necessary, update the version of tzdb to the latest current version,
following the instructions in the <a href="../userguide/tzdb.html">"Updating the time zone database"</a>
section in the user guide.</p>

<h2>Making the release</h2>

<p>If necessary, update the following AssemblyInfo files and NuGet package specs
to include the version number you are building:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>src/NodaTime/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs</code></li>
<li><code>src/NodaTime.Testing/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs</code></li>
<li><code>src/NodaTime/NodaTime.nuspec</code></li>
<li><code>src/NodaTime.Testing/NodaTime.Testing.nuspec</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The various versions should be set according to the following scheme. Suppose
we were building version 1.2.3-beta4, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the NuGet package specs, <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> should contain the version number
('1.2.3-beta4'). The <code>&lt;dependency&gt;</code> element in <code>NodaTime.Testing.nuspec</code>
should reference the <em>initial release</em> for the major/minor version
(i.e. '1.2.0').</li>
<li>In the AssemblyInfo files, <code>AssemblyVersion</code> should be set to just the
major/minor version ('1.2'). <code>AssemblyFileVersion</code> should be set to the
major, minor, and patch version ('1.2.3'), and <code>AssemblyInformationalVersion</code>
should be set to the version number ('1.2.3-beta4'). (See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/65062">this Stack
Overflow post</a> for more information about how these are
used.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the current date and TZDB version to the version history in
<code>tools/userguide-src/markdown/versions.txt</code> and regenerate all documentation.</p>

<p>Commit the above, then tag that commit:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>hg tag 1.0.0-beta1
</code></pre>

<h2>Building the release artifacts</h2>

<p>First, create a new clone for building the release. (Doing this avoids the
need to worry about ignored files and local changes.)</p>

<p>Update to the correct revision, if you didn't specify it when cloning the
repository:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>hg up -r 1.0.0-beta1
</code></pre>

<p>Export the clean source archive:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>hg archive NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1-src.zip
</code></pre>

<p>Next, get ready to build the release zipfile. Create a directory called e.g.
<code>NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1</code> containing the following files and directories:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>docs/api/
docs/developer/
docs/userguide/
LICENSE.txt
NOTICE.txt
readme.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Now build the release libaries, XML documentation, and NuGet packages:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>buildnuget.bat
</code></pre>

<p>This will create e.g. <code>nuget/NodaTime.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg</code> and
<code>nuget/NodaTime.Testing.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg</code>.</p>

<p>Copy the following build outputs into the <em>root</em> of your zipfile directory:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>docs/PublicApi/NodaTime.xml
docs/PublicApi/NodaTime.Testing.xml
src/NodaTime/bin/Release/NodaTime.dll
src/NodaTime.Testing/bin/Release/NodaTime.Testing.dll
</code></pre>

<p>(These are the same files as are present in the NuGet packages.)</p>

<p>Finally, create a zipfile from the zipfile directory (using the same name,
e.g. NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1.zip).</p>

<p>TODO: doing this by hand is a pain.</p>

<h2>Publishing the artifacts</h2>

<p>Upload the source and binary zipfiles to the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/noda-time/downloads/list">Google Code project</a>.
Use the <code>Type-Source</code> label for the source zipfile, and the <code>Type-Archive</code> and
<code>Featured</code> labels for the binary zipfile.  Remove <code>Featured</code> from the previous
binary zipfile.</p>

<p>Upload the two NuGet packages to nuget.org. TODO: How?</p>

<h2>Announcing the release</h2>

<p>Post to the mailing list, blog, etc.</p>

<h2>Post-release branching</h2>

<p>After building the first release with a given minor version number (i.e. 1.0.0,
1.1.0), we'll need to branch before any new user-visible functionality is
introduced (per the <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic versioning</a> spec).</p>

<p>The branching model used by Noda Time is the Mercurial '<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/StandardBranching">standard branching</a>'
model. In brief:</p>

<ul>
<li>feature development is carried out on the default branch</li>
<li>named branches (called '1.0.x', '1.1.x', etc) are used for release lines</li>
<li>fixes are typically applied to the oldest branch and forward-ported to
each later branch in turn (ending at 'default')</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the last point, which may be surprising: Mercurial has no built in support
for the 'backport' or 'cherrypick' model (where fixes are applied to the
mainline and then later applied to an older branch). Instead, the fixes are
first applied to the <em>oldest</em> branch, and then each branch is merged completely
into the next (resolving conflicts as-needed).</p>

<p>If a backport is necessary (for example, if it was not obvious that a fix
applied to an older version), then it can be applied using <code>hg export</code> / <code>hg
import</code> and then forward-ported as usual.</p>

<p>Note also the difference between the format of names used for tags
('1.0.0-beta2', '1.0.0') and those used for branches ('1.0.x'). Mercurial will
allow both to be used as revision specifiers, so it is important that they do
not collide.</p>
