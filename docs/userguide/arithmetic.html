    <title>Date and Time Arithmetic in Noda Time</title>

    <h1>Date and Time Arithmetic in Noda Time</h1>
    <p>There are two types of arithmetic in Noda Time: arithmetic on the
time line (in some sense "absolute" arithmetic), and calendrical arithmetic.
Noda Time deliberately separates the two, with the aim of avoiding
subtle bugs where developers may be tempted to mix concepts inappropriately.</p>

<h2>Time Line Arithmetic</h2>

<p>The <a href="../api/html/T_NodaTime_Instant.htm"><code>Instant</code></a> and
<a href="../api/html/T_NodaTime_ZonedDateTime.htm"><code>ZonedDateTime</code></a> types both unambiguously
refer to a point in time. We can add a length of time to that point to get
another point in time - but only if it's a truly fixed length of time, such as
"3 minutes". While a minute is a fixed length of time, a month isn't - so
the concept of adding "3 months" to an instant makes no sense.</p>

<p>These "fixed lengths of time" are represented in Noda Time with the
<a href="../api/html/T_NodaTime_Duration.htm"><code>Duration</code></a> type, and they can be
added to either an <code>Instant</code> or <code>ZonedDateTime</code> using either the <code>+</code> operator
or <code>Plus</code> methods:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>Duration duration = Duration.FromMinutes(3);
Instant now = SystemClock.SystemNow;    
Instant future = now + duration; // Or now.Plus(duration)

ZonedDateTime nowInIsoUtc = now.InIsoUtc();
ZonedDateTime thenInIsoUtc = nowInIsoUtc + duration;
</code></pre>

<p>(There are also static <code>Add</code> and <code>Subtract</code> methods, the <code>-</code> operator and
the instance <code>Minus</code> method on both <code>Instant</code> and <code>ZonedDateTime</code>.)</p>

<p>Time line arithmetic is pretty simple, except you might not <em>always</em> get
what you expect when you add time to a <code>ZonedDateTime</code>, due to daylight savings:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>DateTimeZone london = DateTimeZone.ForId("Europe/London");
// 12:45am on March 27th 2012
LocalDateTime local = new LocalDateTime(2012, 3, 27, 0, 45, 00);
ZonedDateTime before = london.AtExactly(local);
ZonedDateTime after = before + Duration.FromMinutes(20);
</code></pre>

<p>We start off with a <em>local</em> time of 12.45am. The time that we add is effectively
"experienced" time - as if we'd simply waited twenty minutes. However, at 1am on that day,
the clocks in the Europe/London time zone go forward by an hour - so we end up with a local
time of 2:05am, not the 1:05am you might have expected.</p>

<p>The reverse effect can happen at the other daylight saving transition, when clocks go backward
instead of forward: so twenty minutes after 1:45am could easily be 1:05am! So even though we
have a concept of "local time" in <code>ZonedDateTime</code>, any arithmetic performed on it is computed
using the underlying time line.</p>

<h2>Calendrical Arithmetic</h2>
