    <h1>Unit testing with Noda Time</h1>
    <p>This page is not about how Noda Time itself is tested - it's about how you to test code
which <em>uses</em> Noda Time.</p>

<h2>NodaTime.Testing</h2>

<p>Firstly, get hold of the <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/NodaTime.Testing">NodaTime.Testing</a> assembly. It's currently fairly
small, but it will no doubt grow - and it will make your life much easier. The purpose of the assembly is to provide
easy-to-use fakes which can be used instead of the real implementations.</p>

<p>(Incomplete, obviously.)</p>
