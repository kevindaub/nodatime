(This document will become part of the proper docs eventually.)

The names are meant to broadly reflect those in Joda Time, with the
following changes:

- Interfaces now being with I as per .NET conventions
- Acronyms are only capitalised for the first letter (e.g.
UtcProvider)
- The Readable* interfaces are now just I*, e.g. IInstant, IPartial
  etc. I haven't checked, but I suspect that part of the reason for
  the "Readable" prefix was because in Java there's no I prefix
  convention for interfaces; the I prefix allows a simple "default"
  implementation of an interface with effectively the same name.
- The ReadWritable* interfaces are now IMutable*. (We will explicitly
  define that any implementation of IFoo but not IMutableFoo must be
  immutable.)
- Namespaces have been expanded appropriately; I'm still looking for
  a better name than "Format"
- DateTime is still a problem. I haven't come up with anything better
  yet. Instant sounded good - until I spotted that there was already
  an Instant type. Oops. I did try "ZonedInstant" but that's awful.
  Suggestions welcome.
- Base* classes are now *Base to match .NET conventions
- The DateTimeFormat, ISODateTimeFormat etc classes are now named 
  *Factory, but I'm wondering about DateTimeFormatters etc instead,
  so you'd use DateTimeFormatters.ForPattern etc. Alternatively,
  why not put it into DateTimeFormatter in the first place?
